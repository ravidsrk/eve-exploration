# eve-exploration

Public catalog of **[Vercel eve](https://vercel.com/docs/eve) agents** — 75 working agents with live evidence.

| Layer | Path | Count | What |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Catalog** | [`agents/catalog/`](agents/catalog/) | 50 | Real-world job templates |
| **Reference** | [`agents/reference/`](agents/reference/) | 10 | Ported vercel/eve e2e fixtures + evals |
| **Production** | [`agents/production/`](agents/production/) | 10 | Deep agents with custom tools |
| **Integrations** | [`agents/integrations/`](agents/integrations/) | 5 | Eve primitive proofs (HITL, Slack, durability, swarm) |

→ **[AGENT_CATALOG.md](AGENT_CATALOG.md)** · **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** · `npm run catalog:list`

## Quick start

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
npm run verify:catalog

# Run a catalog agent
bash scripts/run-catalog-agent.sh agents/catalog/06-incident-commander 3206 \
  "Load the dossier, analyze records, and write a prioritized action report."

# Run reference evals (vercel/eve fixtures)
cd agents/reference/agent-tools && npx eve eval --strict
```

Keys for live runs: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `SUPERSERVE_API_KEY` in `.secrets/eve.env`.

### Tracks

| Track | When | Inference | Sandbox |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lab** (today) | Local dev, CI structure | OpenRouter (`@eve-catalog/openrouter`) | SuperServe (`@eve-catalog/superserve-backend`) |
| **Vercel** (roadmap) | `vercel deploy` | AI Gateway + OIDC | Vercel Sandbox (default) |

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the phase-by-phase plan to add the Vercel-native track without removing the lab track.

## Layout

```text
agents/           All eve agents (catalog, reference, production, integrations)
packages/         @eve-catalog/profile, openrouter, superserve-backend, agent-kit, monid-tools
scripts/          setup, runners, catalog tools
AGENT_CATALOG.md  Full index
VERIFY-LIVE.md    Live run evidence (catalog 50/50)
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Full structure suite: catalog + runtime + evals + profile tests |
| `npm run test:structure` | Same as `npm test` (keyless) |
| `npm run eval:flagship` | `eve eval --strict` on 06-incident-commander (needs keys / dev server) |
| `npm run catalog:list` | JSON index of all 75 agents |
| `npm run validate:reference` | `eve eval --strict` on reference fixtures |
| `npm run run:production:all` | Live batch production agents |
| `npm run test:hitl` | HITL proof (`integrations/08-hitl`) |
| `npm run test:durable` | Durable resume proof (`integrations/11-durable-resume`) |
